- Our Project will benefit both the Farmers as well as Investors.
- Farmers looking for prospective investors can register on our web portal and get the required investments for their expenses .
- Investors looking for non volatile investment opportunities can invest their money in a part of  expenses of a  particular crop category.
- Thereby, our project acts as a bridge between the investors and the farmers by providing them a portal to fulfil their investment needs and also
farmers securing requisite funding for their produce.
